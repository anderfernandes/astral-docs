###  <i class="hashtag icon"></i> Top Menu

The Top Menu is a global menu at the top of very screen in Admin. Use it to see where you are, as the menu shows the portion of Admin you are currently in. It also has a button to access [Cashier](../cashier) at any moment, which will open it in a new browser tab.

If you click in your name, you will be given access to a screen that will allow you to change your account information such as name and password.

If you are going to be away from the screen, let's say, to go to the restroom, we recommend you logging out. Make sure you save any new data you are entering into the system.
