Astral is the work of Anderson Fernandes and is currently being used at the Mayborn Science Theater in Killeen, Texas.

The main goal of this project is to give power to non-profit organizations so that they can focus on educating the general population about science and technology, rather than spending hours writing things down by hand and dealing with financial paperwork. These organizations have some of the best people working for them, but struggle to find good software to allow them to focus on what they really matters.

This software is currently in alpha.
