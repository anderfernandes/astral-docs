As of release 1.0.0-alpha1, Astral has two main interfaces: admin and cashier. Their names were made simple so that any user could pick up on their purpose just by looking at them. Astral tries to keep everything as simple as possible.

### 0. Loging In

After Astral has been setup in your organization, you may login using the URL provided to you by the person who set it up. As soon as you access the URL in your browser, you will see the login screen.

We recommend using modern browsers such as the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge. Internet Explorer is not guaranteed to work.

If you don't have an account, you should create one by clicking in Register. Fill out and submit the form and you should be good to go.

### 1. Admin

Astral Admin is where managers should do most of the work. That's where they are going to add shows to their database, create events, create sales, take payments, etc.

After log in, you will be taken to the dashboard. If you are not a manager, you may click the button at the top to access the cashier interface, that's where we recommend regular staff members in your organization to do their work.

The dashboard contains information on sales and events. It is a good place to know how many tickets your organization sold in the past couple of days.

At the top right corner of the page you will see the <i class="sidebar icon"></i> button. This is the sidebar button and will be reffered as so from now on. This is where you are going to access the other portions of Astral Admin. Click on it once and see the options you have. You will see more or less items depending on what kind of access the administrator gave you.
