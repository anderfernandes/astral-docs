After several days and nights of work, sweat, blood and tears... Our second alpha release is here!

If you are not familiar with the process involving software development, one of the approaches is to release preview versions. Our alpha1 was very important and helped us find several bugs. Astral is still far from perfection, but it is already in use for production, something that I am very proud of.

Let's go over the new features!

### Bulletin

This was the last new feature I worked on during alpha1. Communication is key to any organization, no matter the size or kind. People were leaving notes on bugs in notes on my desk instead of email and I was the only one who knew about the bugs. Since no one who works with me is a developer, they could not properly report bugs. To fix this, I created Bulletin.

Bulletin is nothing but a message board or forum to help your staff communicate.

### Reports

You can now view/print several reports on your organization. As of this version you have access to Cashier, Royalties and Membership reports. For more information, please visit the docs.

###  Calendar

Instead of having two calendars, there is only one. However, you have two views: Reservations, which shows Sales made for school groups and such, and Events, which shows scheduled events. You can switch back and forth at any time and the respective view will instantly load.

### Search

As our database started increasing, we needed to filter and search items. This feature was added to make your life easier. You can search for Shows, Users, Members, Organizations and Sales.

Of course those were not the only changes. There are tons of bug fixes and improvements that I will try to cover in a different blog post.

The alpha2 documentation is still a work in progress so please look forward to it!
