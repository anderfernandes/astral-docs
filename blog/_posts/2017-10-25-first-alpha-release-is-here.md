Hi! I am Anderson Fernandes, the creator of Astral.

Defining this project for me is a really hard thing to do because it does a lot of things. Basically, I designed it to be a replacement for ticketing systems like Ticketmaster's Vista, Vendini and ZOZI.

Our Science Theater tried to get these systems, but like many non profits, our tight budget did not allow. I decided to secretly take on this challenge and finally told our director about it.

I have been working pretty hard in the last couple of days to reach this milestone. This project started slowly about two years ago and this is the the first time I have an MVP with some of the features we need at the Mayborn Science Theater.

This is the first public release of Astral. A few things are still not working as I intended them to, like the Dashboard, but you can do what I call "The Empty Flow": add shows, add event type, add events under that type, add organization type, add the organization, add the individual and create a sale for them. Depending what you have or not, you may be able to skip some of the steps. The regular "Flow" should be adding an event and then a sale for an individual and/or group. Sounds complicated but I promise: it's pretty simple.

To end this post, I would like to thank everyone who supported me in this crazy adventure so far. You know who you are. I couldn't have done without you. Same goes to my mother and sister. I love you two very much.

Don't forget to shift the focus of your organiztion to your customers, not to bureaucracy!

PS: Big thanks to Ms. E for teaching me how to spell bureaucracy =)
