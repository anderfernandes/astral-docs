excerpt: A sneak peak of the new sales screen for admin and cashier.

Man, it has been a while since I've been able to post anything! If you thought
Astral was no more, you are wrong! We are working really hard to reach our goal
to make the next release solid enough for your non-profit's daily needs in managing
sales, users, members and events.

Our third alpha release is going to have several additions that I am planning on
writing about for the next couple of days. We are stronger than ever!

In this post I want to show you our new sales screen. Not the one that cashiers
use to sell tickets, but the one that staff memebrs in your organization will use
to create sales when they are not running the tickets desk.

One of the shortcomings of the sales screen we have in alpha2 is that you always
have to select an organization and a customer for a sale. What if you that user
is not part of an organization? Also, with a whole bunch of events on the database,
the dropdown for selecting events starting to have way too much data. What about
the fact that you can add at most two events in a sale?

We fixed all of those problems! We also added a new feature: products. Yes! Now
you can sell products in sales, besides selling tickets. You may also add what
school grades these students are in! Heck, you can even sell only products if you
want! I don't know why we didn't think of all that earlier...

All you have to do now is select if that sale is for a customer or organization,
select who the customer is, pick the date the event is happening which will fetch
events ONLY happening that particular day and select products that will be added
to a sale. Also, you can add as many events as you want to a particular sale. Neat!

In the next blog post is going to be about what is new in Calendar. There is quite
a lot. See you then!
