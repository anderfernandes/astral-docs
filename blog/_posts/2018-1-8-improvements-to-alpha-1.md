The past few months have been really exciting to me as I keep on building this system. I am very thankful for what I have learned and the support I have been getting from my coworkers and loved ones. Let's go over some of the improvements we have added as of today:

1. (Admin) Dashboard shows more detailed information on the "Feed" section.
2. (Admin) The user interface elements in Calendar and Events have been improved. You can now, for example, change the calendar view:

3. (Admin and Cashier) Members can now have dependents.
4. (Admin and Cashier) Several improvements to Sales: You can create a new Sale based on Event Types set up under Settings in Admin. Also, only Customers that belong to the Organization will show in the dropdown. *Note that in Calendar and Events you also need to select what kind of Event you are creating a Sale for.*
5. (Cashier) Selecting a non-cash payment method will automatically fill the "tendered" field.
6. We have added a public Calendar, which shows a list of events coming up and is automatically updated. I made this for your staff so that they know the groups that will be coming to visit your Science Center. To access it, go to **http://your-astral-url/calendar**.

7. Upcoming Shows, for your visitors to know what shows are played that day in in the next 7 days and is automatically updated. To access it, go to **http://your-astral-url/upcoming**.

Items 6 and 7 are perfect for a nice and large screen, that's what I had in mind when I made them. That's how we are using them at the Mayborn Science Theater.

I already have a lot more in mind for Astral so keep checking back for more updates. Happy new year!
