Hi! I am Anderson Fernandes, the developer of Astral.

Defining this project for me is a really hard thing to do because it does a lot of things. Basically, I designed it to be a replacement for ticketing systems like Ticketmaster's Vista, Vendini and ZOZI.

Our Science Theater tried to get these systems, but like many non profits, our tight budget did not allow. I decided to secretly take on this challenge and finally told our director about it.

I have been working pretty hard in the last couple of days to reach this milestone. This project started slowly about two years ago and this is the the first time I have an MVP with some of the features we need at the Mayborn Science Theater.

This is the first public release of Astral.
