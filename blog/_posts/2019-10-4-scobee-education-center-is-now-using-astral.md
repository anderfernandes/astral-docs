We are produd to announce that the Scobee Education Center, in San Antonio, Texas is now using Astral
and I couldn't be happier. I worked closely together with the staff and IT engineers at San Antonio
College, their parent organization, to implement Astral. After several meetings over the course of about
six months, their staff and visitors can finally have it easier than before.

It all started when I got a phone call asking what program we used at the Mayborn Science Theater 
(by the way, there is at least one more great story that starts like this). What sparked their attention 
was the fact that our members went to them with a nice proof of membership. Although they had a membership
program in which they even made membership cards themselves, they were unhappy with their current method
of tracking member visits.

After the first contact, we had meetings with several people from different departments of the San Antonio
College. We tried to support each other as much as we could in the process of implementing the system
and in the end, they were very happy with the results.

The support did not stop after the implementation. We still have a close relationship with them. Their
feedback has been incredible, to the point that all of the ideas of giving us have been implemented
in the system or will be in our upcoming beta release.

I would like to thank the staff of Scobee Education Center and San Antonio College for being such 
amazing people to work with and for believing in our project. We will continue to support them and plan
on helping any other organization in which Astral can help educate and inspire people of all ages.
